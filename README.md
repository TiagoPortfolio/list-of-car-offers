# [List of Car Offers](https://tiagoportfolio.github.io/list-of-car-offers/)

Deployed at https://tiagoportfolio.github.io/list-of-car-offers/

App that displays a list of car offers using:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4)

For data-fetching, I opted to use **React Query** instead of **Redux** because I don't think it is good practice to store data from the server in **Redux**.  
I like to describe **React Query** as a server state management library where it handles so many things for us out-of-the-box helping us reduce all the boilerplate in our apps (like loading, success, error actions) while customizable at the same time.

To showcase my **Redux** knowledge, I used **Redux Toolkit** to filter the list of offers.
